	<h4>When would you use = vs. == vs/ .equals()? Explain what each of these does.</h4>
	<p>You would use the "=" sign as an assignment operator, to assign values to variables. The "==" is an operator used for comparing two variables to see if they're equal to each other or refering to the same object. It should return a "true" or "false." The .equals() compares two strings, if all the characters match, it'll return "true," if not it'll say "false." In .equals(), the uppercases and lowercases have to match as well.</p>
