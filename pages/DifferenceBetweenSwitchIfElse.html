	<h4>What is the difference between switch and if/else? When would you use one versus the other?</h4>
	<p>Switch is easier to read, manage and add too than if/else statements. Cases within the switch must be literals, while if/else can also use variables. Switches also have fall-throughs, if someone forgets to add a "break" at the end of a case, it will run through all the code in the switch until it finds one.</p>
