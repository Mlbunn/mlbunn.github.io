	<h4>What is the difference between while and do while loops? Give an example of when you would use one versus the other. What is the benefit of a do while over a while?</h4>
	<p>A while loop will continue to execute the code until it reaches the condition specified. A do while loop has the condition placed at the end, so it will execute at least once, check to see if the condition was reached and then decide whether or not to execute again. You use the do while loop if you're certain you want the code to execute at least once before deciding to go multiple times.</p>
